Downloads multiple images from a facebook post

It is in *alpha* phase.<br/>
Too naive to be called a full-fledged script.

PRs welcome.

**TODO:**<br/>
The username, password should be entered from command line.<br/>
File should be saved at user-defined location.<br/>

**Usage:**<br/>
You have to dig in the code. Change the variable for username, password, number of images and the url of first image.<br/>
Good to go now.<br/>

**Requirements:**
- Splinter
